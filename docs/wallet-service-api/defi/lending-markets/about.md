# What are Lending Markets?

A lending market is a platform where users can lend out their cryptocurrency to other users or institutions in exchange for interest payments. This allows lenders to earn passive income on their digital assets, while borrowers can access the funds they need to trade or invest.

Lending markets can be a good option for those looking to earn passive income from their cryptocurrency holdings, as they typically offer higher interest rates than traditional banks or financial institutions. They also allow borrowers to access funds without having to sell their assets, which can be beneficial in a bear market.

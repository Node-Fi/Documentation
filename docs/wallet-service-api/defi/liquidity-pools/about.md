# What are Liquidity Pools?

A liquidity pool is a collection of digital assets that is made available for trading on a decentralized exchange (DEX). The purpose of a liquidity pool is to provide sufficient supply and demand for a particular asset, allowing for more efficient and secure trading.

Liquidity pools are enabled by liquidity providers, who contribute their assets to the pool in exchange for a share of the trading fees generated from the pool. Liquidity providers earn a return on their contribution by providing liquidity to the market and facilitating trades.

To participate in a liquidity pool, users typically need to deposit their assets into the pool and specify the terms of their contribution, such as the proportion of assets they are willing to provide and the duration of their commitment. The platform will then allocate a share of the pool to the user based on their contribution.

Liquidity pools offer several benefits to both traders and liquidity providers. For traders, they provide a more secure and efficient way to buy and sell assets, as the assets are always available in the pool rather than being reliant on a single seller or buyer. For liquidity providers, they offer a way to earn a return on their assets without having to actively trade them.

Some examples of popular liquidity pools in the cryptocurrency space include Uniswap, Balancer, and Bancor.

# What Is Yield Farming

Yield farming, also known as liquidity mining, is a strategy used by cryptocurrency investors to maximize their returns by providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. In exchange for providing liquidity, investors receive a share of the platform's transaction fees and other rewards. Yield farming has become increasingly popular in the DeFi space due to the potential for high returns, but it also carries significant risks and requires a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

To calculate the annual percentage rate (APR) of a yield farm, you can use the following formula:

APR = (reward rate / total value deposited) x 365

Here's an example of how to use this formula:

- Let's say that you deposited 1 ETH (valued at $1,000) into a yield farm that has a reward rate of 10%.
- The reward rate for this yield farm is 10% x $1,000 = $100.
- The APR for this yield farm is ($100 / $1,000) x 365 = 36.5%.

It's important to note that this is just an example and actual yield farm APRs can vary significantly based on a variety of factors, including the platform's fees, the underlying assets, and market conditions. Yield farming can also be highly volatile, and investors should carefully consider the risks and potential rewards before committing their funds.

## What makes Minima unique?

Minima is not your ordinary router. Unlike existing solutions like 0x and 1inch, Minima supports routes through liquidity pool (LP) tokens, Mento, farming contracts, gauges, liquid staking contracts, and more. In this way, you can view Minima as ‘The Everything Router.’ Fully on-chain and non-custodial.&#x20;

## Example use-cases

1. Offer the most price-efficient swaps in your application
2. Let your users cash-in/out to any currency by routing their order to the most liquid token
3. 1-click yield for any yield-bearing position (yield farms, lending, etc)
4. Offer price-efficient staking with minting and routing for exiting your stake

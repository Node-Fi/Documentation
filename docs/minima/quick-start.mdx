# Quick Start

## API keys (optional)

API Keys are entirely optional, so why even use one for your integration?

1. üîç Tracking volume! API Keys are how we can track volume per integration, and provide you with details on volume that moves through your specific integration.
2. üí∏ Set your own custom trade fee. This fee will be directed to your configured fee collector address

To get your API keys, head over to [nodefinance.org](https://nodefinance.org) and click "Start for free." Once you create your account, log-in, go to the "Mission Control" section and click "API Keys" to generate your keys.

## Include API Keys

Include your API key in the header such as the following:

```
X-API-KEY = <API Key>
```

<div class="alert alert--info">
  Good to know: API Keys are entirely optional, your integration will still work
  without them!
</div>

## Make your first request

To make your first request, send an authenticated request to the pets endpoint. This will calculate a route.

{% swagger src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Node-Fi/Specs/main/NodeRouter.yaml" path="/routes" method="get" %}
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Node-Fi/Specs/main/NodeRouter.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Node-Fi/Specs/main/NodeRouter.yaml)
{% endswagger %}

Take a look at how you might call this method:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="curl" %}

```
curl -X GET -G \
    "https://router.nodefinance.org/routes" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-Api-Key": <API Key> \
    -d inputToken=0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438 \
    -d outputToken=0x73a210637f6F6B7005512677Ba6B3C96bb4AA44B \
    -d inputAmount=10000000000000000000000 \
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

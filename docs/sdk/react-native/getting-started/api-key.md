### Step 2: Generate an API Key
Go to the [Admin > API Keys](https://www.nodefinance.org/admin/apikeys) page and click the refresh button to reveal your key.

:::tip Keep your API key safe!

Your API key used to manage your project. Keep your API keys safe by following best practices, such as:

- Limit access to keys to only those who absolutely need it
- Avoid embedding the key in any version control system you may have
- Leverage professional password managers (ideally not LastPass)
- Never (ever) embed your API key Github PRs, web apps, or anything publicly accessible
